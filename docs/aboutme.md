This page contains texts cleaned up from the data on [Fenno-Ugrica collection](http://fennougrica.kansalliskirjasto.fi/) of the National Library of Finland.

The main work behind this site is done, at least for now, by Niko Partanen. Naturally it is entirely in debt to the work done in Fenno-Ugrica collection. Thanks to them for making these wonderful datasets available and accessible.
